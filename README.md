## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
```
Created a password generator that takes the users input for how many characters(8-128) followed by what they would like to include in the password like lowercase letters and or uppercase letters as well as numbers and special characters. The site uses prompts from javascript to take in the useres information.

## Mock-Up
